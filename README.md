- Hi, I’m @lelanceflamer (Le lance Flamer), I'm a French guy who enjoys programming
- I’m interested in C#, and JavaScript / Typescript. I'm also trying to learn C++.
- I make Windows apps in C# (WinForms and WinUI 3), which is my favorite programming language. In JS (and TS) I make Discord bots and express.js websites backend.
- I also program in Lua but I don't really count it as a true programming language (but not to the point of HTML and CSS) because I only use it for modding on Teardown (for now).

<!---
I have a lot of private repos, code that I've never updated because of laziness, lack of need or some other reason.
