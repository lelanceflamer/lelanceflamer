- I’m @lelanceflamer (Le lance Flamer), I'm a French guy who enjoys programming
- C# is the best language, I use J*vashit / T\*shit whenever I got no choice.
- I make WinForms and WinUI 3 sometimes. I gave up j*vashit tbh; too ugly and weak.
- I also do stuff in Lua for modding Teardown. (It released multiplayer beta and I still haven't tried it)
- I have too many private repos, either because my code is so bad that it'd kill people, or that I just want to keep private (useless programs / just personal shiz)

<!---
I have a lot of private repos, code that I've never updated because of laziness, lack of need or some other reason.
